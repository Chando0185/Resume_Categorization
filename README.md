# Resume Categorization
Objective: Design, implement, and train a machine learning model to automatically categorize resumes based on their domain (e.g., sales, marketing, etc.). Following this, develop a script that can be run via the command line to process a batch of resumes, categorize them, and output results to both directory structures and a CSV file.
